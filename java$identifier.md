# Java Identifiers

### An identifier in Java is the name given to Variables, Classes, Methods, Packages, Interfaces, etc. These are the unique names used to identify programming elements. Every Java Variable must be identified with a unique name.

exmample :class Rudra {
    public static void main(String[] args){
        int x = 9; 
    }
}

Rules for identifiers :
- The only allowed characters for identifiers are all alphanumeric characters([A-Z],[a-z],[0-9]), '$'(dollar sign) and '_' (underscore). For example, "oretes@" is not a valid Java identifier as it contains a '@', a special character.
- Identifiers should not start with digits([0-9]). For example, "123oretes" is not a valid Java identifier.
- Java identifiers are case-sensitive.
- There is no limit on the length of the identifier, but it is advisable to use an optimum length of 4 - 15 letters only.
- Reserved Words can't be used as an identifier. For example, "int while = 20;" is an invalid statement as a while is a reserved word.

### In Java, reserved words are predefined identifiers that have a specific meaning in the language. They cannot be used as variable names, method names, class names, or identifiers, because they are part of the syntax of Java.
