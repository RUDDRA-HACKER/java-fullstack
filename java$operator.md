## java operator
------------------------------
### Java operators are special symbols that perform operations on variables or values. These operators are essential in programming as they allow you to manipulate data efficiently.

example:

```java 
public class GFG{
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int a = 10, b = 3;
        
        // Addition
        int sum = a + b;
        
        // Subtraction
        int diff = a - b;
        
        // Multiplication
        int mul = a * b;
        
        // Division
        int div = a / b;
        
        // Modulus
        int mod = a % b;      // Modulus

        System.out.println("Sum: " + sum);
        System.out.println("Difference: " + diff);
        System.out.println("Multiplication: " + mul);
        System.out.println("Division: " + div);
        System.out.println("Modulus: " + mod);
    }
}
```
